# Update the watersurfaces_refpoints data source

Setting version specific information, defining what the 'previous' and 'current' version mean.
The current version refers to the version of watersurfaces_hab to be used to derive new points for watersurfaces_refpoints.

```{r}
previous_version <- "v5"
current_version <- "v6"
xxh64sum_refpoints_previous_tsv <- "8b74e5f80082595b"
xxh64sum_refpoints_previous_yml <- "e8376d961a06e76a"
xxh64sum_wsh_previous <- "bd860c4d8b2b1de7"
xxh64sum_wsh_current <- "e2920c4932008387"
```

Locating `n2khab_data`.

```{r}
n2khab_data_path <- locate_n2khab_data()
```

Note that the code requires a setup of `n2khab_data` that supports concurrent versions, by implementing approach \[3] of <https://github.com/inbo/n2khab/issues/113>.

## Reading the previous versions of watersurfaces_refpoints and watersurfaces_hab

Verifying and reading the previous version of watersurfaces_refpoints.

```{r}
refpoints_path_previous <- file.path(
  n2khab_data_path,
  str_c(
    "20_processed/_versions/watersurfaces_refpoints/watersurfaces_refpoints_",
    previous_version
  )
)
# file version verification
stopifnot(
  xxh64sum(file.path(refpoints_path_previous, "watersurfaces_refpoints.tsv")) ==
    xxh64sum_refpoints_previous_tsv
)
stopifnot(
  xxh64sum(file.path(refpoints_path_previous, "watersurfaces_refpoints.yml")) ==
    xxh64sum_refpoints_previous_yml
)
# read as tibble and update column name
refpoints_previous <- 
  read_vc("watersurfaces_refpoints", root = refpoints_path_previous) %>% 
  as_tibble()
```

Verifying and reading the previous version of watersurfaces_hab.

```{r}
wsh_path_previous <- file.path(
  n2khab_data_path,
  str_c(
    "20_processed/_versions/watersurfaces_hab/watersurfaces_hab_",
    previous_version
  ),
  "watersurfaces_hab.gpkg"
)
# file version verification
stopifnot(xxh64sum(wsh_path_previous) == xxh64sum_wsh_previous)
# read
wsh_previous <- 
  read_watersurfaces_hab(
    file = wsh_path_previous,
    version = str_c("watersurfaces_hab_", previous_version),
    interpreted = TRUE
  )
```



## Searching for new watersurface polygons in the current version of watersurfaces_hab

Verifying and reading the current version of watersurfaces_hab.

```{r}
wsh_path_current <- file.path(
  n2khab_data_path,
  str_c(
    "20_processed/_versions/watersurfaces_hab/watersurfaces_hab_",
    current_version
  ),
  "watersurfaces_hab.gpkg"
)
# file version verification
stopifnot(xxh64sum(wsh_path_current) == xxh64sum_wsh_current)
# read
wsh <- 
  read_watersurfaces_hab(
    file = wsh_path_current,
    version = str_c("watersurfaces_hab_", current_version),
    interpreted = TRUE
  )
```

Checking that all polygons of the previous version of watersurfaces_hab are present in the previous version of watersurfaces_refpoints.

```{r}
wsh_previous$watersurfaces_polygons %>% 
  anti_join(refpoints_previous, join_by(polygon_id)) %>% 
  nrow() == 0
```

New watersurfaces in the current version of watersurfaces_hab that originate from the watersurfaces data source:

```{r paged.print = FALSE}
wsh_new_ws <- 
  wsh$watersurfaces_polygons %>% 
  anti_join(refpoints_previous, join_by(polygon_id)) %>% 
  filter(!str_detect(polygon_id, "_v"))
wsh_new_ws
```

New polygons in the current version of watersurfaces_hab that originate from the habitatmap_stdized data source:

```{r paged.print = FALSE}
wsh_new_hms <- 
  wsh$watersurfaces_polygons %>% 
  anti_join(refpoints_previous, join_by(polygon_id)) %>% 
  filter(str_detect(polygon_id, "_v"))
wsh_new_hms
```

Checking that new polygons from habitatmap_stdized really are new and don't overlap older habitatmap polygons in watersurfaces_hab.
This cannot normally be the case since watersurfaces_hab versions are not based on their previous version.

```{r}
wsh_old_hms <- 
  wsh$watersurfaces_polygons %>% 
  semi_join(refpoints_previous, join_by(polygon_id)) %>% 
  filter(str_detect(polygon_id, "_v"))
nrow(wsh_new_hms[wsh_old_hms, ]) == 0
```



## Defining new reference points

Generating the points to be added to the previous version of watersurfaces_refpoints.

```{r}
refpoints_new <- 
  wsh$watersurfaces_polygons %>% 
  select(polygon_id) %>% 
  anti_join(refpoints_previous, join_by(polygon_id)) %>% 
  st_sf(agr = "identity") %>% 
  st_point_on_surface() %>% 
  mutate(
    x = round(st_coordinates(.)[, 1], 2),
    y = round(st_coordinates(.)[, 2], 2)
  ) %>%
  st_drop_geometry()
```



## Writing new version of watersurfaces_refpoints

Setting target directory.

```{r}
refpoints_path_current <- file.path(
  n2khab_data_path,
  str_c(
    "20_processed/_versions/watersurfaces_refpoints/watersurfaces_refpoints_",
    current_version
  )
)
```

Copying previous version into target directory, so that overwriting it with git2rdata will minimize diffs between versions.

```{r}
file.copy(
  file.path(
    refpoints_path_previous,
    str_c("watersurfaces_refpoints",c(".tsv", ".yml"))),
  refpoints_path_current,
  overwrite = TRUE
) %>% 
  invisible()
```

Combining previous and new refpoints and writing as the new version of watersurfaces_refpoints.
We only use `polygon_id`, `x` and `y` columns as these are the ones unique to this data object.
Spatial attributes can always be added as needed, provided that the CRS is set correctly (EPSG:31370).

```{r}
refpoints_previous %>% 
  select(polygon_id, x, y) %>% 
  bind_rows(refpoints_new) %>% 
  arrange(polygon_id) %>% 
  write_vc(
    "watersurfaces_refpoints",
    root = refpoints_path_current,
    sorting = "polygon_id",
    strict = FALSE,
    digits = 6
  )
```
