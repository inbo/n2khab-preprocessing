# Making a simple version of the `soilmap` data source

As we incorporated two handles for processing the raw `soilmap` data source in the `read_soilmap()` function,
we can implement directly as follows:

```{r}
soilmap_simple <- read_soilmap(use_processed = FALSE,
                               standardize_polders = TRUE,
                               simplify = TRUE)
```

# Writing the result as a GeoPackage

```{r}
datapath <- fileman_up("n2khab_data")
```

```{r}
dir.create(file.path(datapath, "20_processed/soilmap_simple"), recursive = TRUE)
```


```{r}
st_write(soilmap_simple,
         file.path(datapath, 
                   "20_processed/soilmap_simple/soilmap_simple.gpkg"), 
         layer = "soilmap_simple", 
         driver = "GPKG",
         delete_dsn = TRUE)
```
